# LangGraph Workflows

Welcome to **LangGraph Workflows** — a collection of practical workflow experiments built using **LangGraph** and **Groq LLMs** (or other LLMs).  
These notebooks demonstrate key LangGraph concepts such as workflow orchestration, structured prompting, and integration with large language models.

## 🧠 📌 Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook workflows that showcase how to build modular and reusable AI pipelines using LangGraph.

Each file demonstrates a different pattern or use case:

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `bmi_cal.ipynb` | A simple illustrative workflow to calculate BMI using LangGraph state transitions. |
| `llm_api.ipynb` | Demonstrates LangGraph integration with an LLM API (e.g. Groq/OpenAI) for text generation tasks. |
| `prompt_chaining.ipynb` | Shows prompt chaining techniques — passing outputs from one LLM prompt as inputs to another. |

These workflows act as examples for structuring AI systems safely, repeatably, and in a state-driven manner using LangGraph. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
